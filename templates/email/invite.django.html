<p>For our beta, we're using Facebook Connect to handle invites and
authenticate new users. We won't show your Facebook profile photo
or name anywhere on the site and will only store your e-mail
address for future updates.</p>
{% endif %}

<p>We want Canvas to be the best place to share and play with images.
Remember that Canvas is a worksafe site. Please use common sense,
keep it clean, and respect copyrights.</p>

<p>Canvas in its current form represents just a kernel of our
long-term vision for the site, and we couldn't be more excited
about what's in store. We look forward to having you try it out 
as we spend the next few months collecting feedback, learning, 
tweaking, and building the best site possible.</p>

<p>Thank you for participating in the beta!</p>

<p>-Canvas Team</p>
